About

I provide you an nonjudgemental, unfiltered & unabashed female perspective on whatever relationship or sexual issue it is you're going through.

What's your fetish? 

How did you get into this? 

What methods of payment do you accept? 

Are you dating anyone? 

If I pay you more, will you meet me in person? 

Why don't you just become a therapist? 

What makes you qualified? 

Why don't you book sessions on the weekdays? 

Are there any topics you don't cover? 

How do I know you'll keep confidentiality? 

What if I don't have enough time for a half hour session? 

How do I find something serious in NYC? 

Can I just pick your brain even if I'm not dealing any relationship or serious issues at the moment? 

Why should I book a session with you when my  insurance covers a therapist, psychiatrist, marriage counselor, and/or sexual counselor? 

Do you have any reviews? ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9aeafe04-9de3-41af-8fca-a671862c52ca.png)
